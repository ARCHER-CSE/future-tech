# future-tech #

Project for benchmarking ARCHER applications on different technologies. Identify representitive benchmarks and run them on a variety of current and future technologies to understand porting effort required and performance.

Focus in this project is on understanding the broad landscape rather than putting large amounts of effort into porting and optimising codes. The key questions we want to answer for a particular HPC platform are:

* What is the performance like for an application with 1 afternoons porting effort?
* What is the performance like for an application with 3 days porting effort?


# Project Plan #

1. Identify suitable benchmarks
2. Run benchmarks on ARCHER to get baseline performance numbers
3. Identify other HPC platforms
4. Evaluate performance for benchmarks on other HPC platforms
